In this portfolio, I will analyze the Titanic dataset to determine which factors influenced passenger survival. This dataset provides information on the fate of passengers from the Titanic's maiden voyage, including their economic status (class), sex, age, and survival outcome. It contains 2,201 observations across four variables: Class, Sex, Age, and Survived.

```{r}
